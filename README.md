### 💫 About Me:
I’m Nathan, the Founder and Managing Director of DeFinitive.
I established DeFinitive to fuse my two passions within Financial Trading & Technical Recruitment after identifying a niche in the market around Low Latency & Distributed Systems hiring within the global Trading Technology sphere.

I am a seasoned Technology Recruiter benefiting from over 10 years of dedicated technical headhunting experience, I have worked with businesses of all different shapes and sizes from start-ups, SME’s and global enterprise clients and understand first hand the difficulties hiring within a niche landscape and how best to attract top level talent that is individually suited to meet clients’ expectations.

Throughout my career I have proven to be an accomplished consultant and leader, being consecutively recognised as the year-on-year top achiever in previous roles and having been personally shortlisted for nomination as "2019 Permanent Recruitment Consultant of the Year" at the nationwide recruitment IRP Awards.
